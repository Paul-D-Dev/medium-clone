## Context

In order to improve my skills in Angular. I followed a MOOC to learn NGRX. During this training, I developed from scratch a copy of the site https://angular.realworld.io/. This is a blog where we find the general feed, our feed, a connection and registration space, a profile page, the creation of new articles and updates.
